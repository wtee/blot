blot -- a minimalist blog-engine in Bourne shell

Goals:

* Be the simplest, smallest, little blogging engine there is
* Make Blosxom and nanoblogger look like bloatware
* Reinvent the wheel for no good reason

Features:

* Format agnostic. Use whatever mark-up you want for your posts, tell
  blot what parser to use and viola.
* Valid, mobile-friendly HTML5.
* In the public domain. Freer than free software. Use it. Abuse it.
  It's yours. It's everybody's.

blot's a script I wrote for fun, although I am actually using it on the
Wild Wild Web. You probably shouldn't. But you can if you want.

To install blot:

1. Have a functioning, CGI-capable web server, that runs Linux or Unix.
2. Move blot.cgi, your parser of choice, and optionally blot.css 
   to the directory on that server you want to run them from.
3. In that same directory create another directory to store your
   blog posts.
4. Edit the configuration variables in blot.cgi to fit your set up.
5. Make sure your new directory, blot.cgi, your parser, and blot.css
   have the correct owner and permissions to be run on your webserver.
   This can generally be accomplished with commands similar to:
     chown www:www blot.cgi blot.css md2html.awk blog/
     chmod 755 blot.cgi blot.css md2html.awk blog/

To use blot:

1. Write a blog post.
2. Put it in your blog directory.
3. Make sure it has the right permissions and ownership.
